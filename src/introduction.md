# Introduction

The Jet engine is a multi-media platform targetting the Go language. It supports an ECMAScript 4 like language, ActionScript 3; an eXtensible Markup Language for the user interface, MXML; and a Cascading Style Sheet 3 dialect.

## Features

### Event model

When compared to standard ActionScript 3, the event model has been simplified due to type inference, and uses shorter notation for the event listener methods.

### Documentation comments

Documentation comments support Markdown and referencing local images.

### Package manager

A productive package manager is supported which facilitates creating new projects and building them. In addition, published packages are automatically queued for documentation generation in the online documentation host.
